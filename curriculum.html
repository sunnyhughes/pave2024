            <h3>Our Curriculum</h3>
                
                <p>PAVE's curriculum strategy involves a structured 12-step approach or 12 focused topics, each addressed every three weeks in a group learning setting. Weekly sessions are facilitated by a PAVE team member and a Presenter active in the community.</p>

                <div class="session-image-container">
                    <p>Sessions are completed in monthly session format. Each month, a new topic will be focused on and discussed over the 3 week time schedule. A comprehensive review of each topic is discussed in week 4. Topics such as: <strong>Communication, Self-love, Co-parenting, and Accountability</strong> are covered.</p>
