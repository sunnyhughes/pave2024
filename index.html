        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <p>Our mission is simple. To engage, empower and equip parents with the necessary skills and resources to strengthen family connectedness and to reduce the rate of violence among youth and young adults.
        </p>

    <section id="goals">
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>

        <p>Our vision is to collaboratively build stable families and reduce the violence within families and communities. PAVE's strategy involves integrating insights from parents and community members impacted by violence to enhance parental and family bonds. This is achieved through a structured 12-step approach or 12 focused topics, each addressed every three weeks in a group learning setting. Additionally, we foster family connections through monthly positive family activities and events, as well as peer-to-peer discussion sessions. </p>

    <section id="curriculum">
        <h2>Curriculum</h2>

        <p>PAVE will partner with organizations and individuals to engage 20-25 parents(per site) annually and provide a 12-month cycled curriculum. This will be implemented in an weekly open-discussion based group meeting, quarterly scheduled family activities and events as well as through peer-to-peer discussion sessions.

        <h2>Outcomes/Results</h2>

        <p>PAVE employs pre and post assessments, coupled with parent self-reporting, to evaluate its impact in the following areas: 

        <ul>
            <li>Supporting and enhancing family function </li>
            <li>Fostering the development of enduring relationships for youth with caring adults</li>
             
            <li>Providing youth with opportunities to cultivate social and emotional competence</li>
             
            <li>Decreasing the incidence of risky behaviors among youth</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Since April 2022, PAVE has consistently conducted its 12- module strategy in the Parkland neighborhood, benefitting more than 85 parents. Utilizing crime data and leveraging existing relationships, PAVE plans to collaborate to expand recruitment and engagement efforts within the Parkhill neighborhood. In the long term, PAVE aims to implement its engagement strategy in a total of six (6) high-risk neighborhoods within Louisville.</p>
