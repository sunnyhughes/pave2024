        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>During the year 2021, a collective of parents and individuals deeply invested in social services collaborated to formulate a strategy aimed at mitigating the prevalence of violence among our youth and young adults. P.A.V.E. operates under the fiscal sponsorship of the Louisville Central Community Center, conducting weekly sessions at the Baptist Fellowship Center (BFC) in Louisville, Kentucky.</p>
